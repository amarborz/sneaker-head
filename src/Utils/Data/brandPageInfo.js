		text: `Adidas is a German multinational corporation, founded and headquartered in Herzogenaurach,
     Bavaria, that designs and manufactures shoes, clothing and accessories. It is the largest 
     sportswear manufacturer in Europe, and the second largest in the world, after Nike. 
     The company was started by Adolf Dassler in his mother's house; he was joined by his 
     elder brother Rudolf in 1924 under the name Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik ("Dassler Brothers 
     Shoe Factory"). Dassler assisted in the development of spiked running shoes (spikes) for multiple
     athletic events. To enhance the quality of spiked athletic footwear, he transitioned from a
     previous model of heavy metal spikes to utilising canvas and rubber. Dassler persuaded U.S.
     sprinter Jesse Owens to use his handmade spikes at the 1936 Summer Olympics. In 1949, 
     following a breakdown in the relationship between the brothers, Adolf created Adidas,
     and Rudolf established Puma, which became Adidas' business rival. The three stripes 
     are Adidas' identity mark, having been used on the company's clothing and shoe designs
     as a marketing aid.`,

  athletes worldwide. Onitsuka became particularly renowned for the
  Mexico 66 design—in which the distinctive crossed stripes (now
  synonymous with the company brand) were featured for the first time.
  Martial-arts star Bruce Lee was the first known celebrity to
  popularize this design. Onitsuka Tiger merged with GTO and JELENK to
  form ASICS Corporation in 1977. The name is an acronym for the Latin
  phrase "anima sana in corpore sano" (a sound mind, in a sound body).
